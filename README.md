## Overview
 I Design the Global Chef website using React-Bootstrap (MDB React) and added some complex features and functionality to it.
The Project Challenge
Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Fill in all fields in the form
- Receive form validations if fields are missed or incorrect during registration
- Enrol in a class
- Explore different classes and videos
 
## My process
The project is a hard task and it took me four weeks to complete. I did the project to help me understand how react.js works. This is the first project I did with React.js It has helped me improve my coding skills by building real projects. 

## Built with
- HTML5 
- CSS 
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- MdB React
- Javascript
- Firebase
 
## What I learned
The project exposes me to react. This is the first project I built with React.js. I learnt how to use MDB React and I understand better the principle of React.js with this project.


## Continued development
I will love to focus more on the Backend and Database for the project and other projects too.

## Deployement
I deploy the website on Github and host it on Firebase.


### My Installation steps

## Step 1
Create React App. We are using React 17+ version.
